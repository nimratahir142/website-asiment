        <h2 id="name">Understanding the Basics of HTML <br> Websites</h2>
        <p id="abc">HTML, which stands for <a href="">Hypertext Markup Language</a> is the primary language of <br> the
            World Wide Web. An
            HTML
            document sets the content and structure of a web <br> page. When you view a page in your browser, what
            you’re
            looking
            at is your <br> browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server.</p>
        <p id="ab">"HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end languages: <br> CSS and
            JavaScript.
            <a href="">CSS (Cascading
                Style Sheets)</a> is a language that controls <br> the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts,
            and
            layouts.
            <a href="">JavaScript</a> is a <br> programming language that enables more complex client-side <br> features
            like interactive
            elements
            and animations.
        </p>
        <p id="cd">"The most recent numbered release of HTML is HTML5. Released in 2008, <a href=""> HTML5 <br> notably
                contained </a> several
            improvements to handle multimedia content like audio <br> and video and <a href="">semantically rich
                elements</a> to describe
            page
            structure.</p>
        <p id="ef">"Going forward, there will be no more numbered version numbers for HTML. That <br> means there will
            be no
            HTML6, and
            HTML5 is now called “HTML.” However, a <br> number of improvements and enhancements have been released since
            HTML5 <br>
            came out in 2008.</p>
        <p id="fg">"If you want to know more about HTML and how to write it, I recommend starting <br> with our <a
                href="">ultimate guide to HTML.</a>
            You’ll learn everything you need to know to <br> understand this post in its entirety.</p>
        <p id="lm">"Because every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site <br> or the
            number of
            technologies
            involved, it’s a good idea to immerse yourself in it <br>And yes, this is true even if the website uses
            server-side
            languages like PHP (such <br> <a href="">WordPress)</a>. With a tool like WordPress, the web server will
            process
            the PHP <br> and
            query the site's database to <a href="">generate the finished HTML document</a> to deliver <br> to visitors'
            browsers.</p>
        <p id="mn">"You can take any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <br> code that bring
            it
            to life.</p>

        <p id="le">To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), I think it’s a good <br> idea for you
            to
            create a
            website or two from scratch.</p>
        <p id="en">Even building a relatively simple HTML website can help you learn how HTML <br> works and provide you
            with a solid
            foundation before you move on to more <br> advanced projects.</p>
        <p id="me">"Here are some ideas for <a href="">beginner-friendly simple HTML projects</a> you can create:</p>
        <ul id="so">
            <li>A personal website. Create a <a href="">personal site</a> that shows off <a href="">your resume</a>,
                work
                <br> experience, interests, skills,
                and personality. You can return to this project and <br> revise over time as your skills develop.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul id="ce">
            <li>An informational site.Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple <br> website that teaches
                visitors about it. You can play around with various <br> technologies to enhance your storytelling —
                we'll
                share
                some examples below.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul id="th">
            <li>A small business website or a non-profit website. You can volunteer to create <br> a <a href="">website
                    for
                    a small local
                    business</a> in your area. Or, you can help a non-profit <br> and give it an online presence.</li>
            <br>
            <li>A blog. While there are many great <a href="">blogging platforms</a> out there, consider <br> making
                your
                own. A simple HTML
                website can work great for basic blogs.</li>
            <li>A portfolio. Want to <a href="">show off your other creative works?</a> Try building a <br> portfolio,
                be
                it a <a href="">photo gallery</a>, a
                video showcase, or a <a href="">collection of your <br> writing</a>. The best part? We even have a <a
                    href="">step-by-step guide for
                    beginners on <br> how to create a portfolio site with HTML.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p id="ge">To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this excellent <br> tutorial <a
                href="">from freeCodeCamp</a>.
        </p>
        <p id="as">As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out <br> into bolder, more
            unique
            design
            choices. But still, even elaborate websites can <br> often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features
            working
            together to make a <br> cohesive experience.</p>
        <p id="esb">Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements <br> creatively. I’ll also

        <p id="ke"><b>What I like:</b> Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston <br> Texas, that
            features a
            vibrant,
            immaculately crafted website. While the hero <br> section isn‘t anything too crazy, you’ll experience tons
            of
            interesting effects as you <br> scroll down the page.</p>
        <p id="gn">"At first glance, this site may look technically complex. However, you can achieve <br> most of the
            effects with plain
            HTML and CSS. While there’s an occasional <br> JavaScript-powered effect (for instance, animated text and a
            card
            slider), a lot of <br> this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors, fonts, and images.</p>
        <p id="ce">"It’s worth digging into the page's source code if you’re curious. For example, when <br> I checked
            out
            the code, I
            could see that Gloutir used Webflow to build its site and <br> some of the different HTML techniques that
            the
            site
            relies on.</p>
        <p id="rn">"Check out our <a href="">guide to the “inspect element” tool</a> to learn how you can do the same.
        </p>
        <p id="ld">"If you want to inspect the code of a website, my experience is that <a href="">Chrome offers <br>
                the
                best developer tools</a> (like
            “inspect element”). However, most other browsers <br> also offer developer tools.</p>
        <p id="e">"Pro Tip: Need help choosing a <a href="">color scheme for your site?</a> Here are a few I love.</p>

        <p id="al"><b>What I like:</b> Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive <br> Joshua‘s
            World
            website
            to
            connect
            with potential clients. Visitors start on a simple <br> welcome screen but can then enter the much more
            engaging
            Joshua’s World <br> interface.</p>
        <p id="tsfg">Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s <br> various
            projects
            and learning
            more about his experience. I think it’s much more <br> engaging than a traditional portfolio that lists
            projects
            as
            thumbnails. And, given <br> that Joshua is an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off
            what
            <br> he
            can do.
        </p>
        <p id="jn">While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure HTML, the <br> interactive
            elements rely on
            JavaScript. Joshua also uses the Sanity content <br> management system to help him manage his site’s
            content.

            <br>
            developers can use to build
            server-side web applications. The Ruby on Rails <br> website does a great job of communicating that with a
            clean,
            modern design.
        </p>
        <p id="milki">I especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its color <br> and
            typography choices,
            rather than relying on more complex animations. The red <br> headings give a pop of color, while the actual
            design is simple.</p>
        <p id="lump">The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling. None of the effects <br> that you
            see require
            JavaScript. For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates <br> interesting hover effects using basic CSS.</p>
        <p id="asma">I think that it‘s a great reminder that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript <br> effects to
            build a great
            HTML website. Those elements can help in certain <br> situations, especially with engagement and
            storytelling (as
            many of my other <br> examples show). However, they are not a requirement to build an engaging website.</p>
        <p id="purii">Pro Tip: Make your website more engaging with thoughtful <a href="">CSS animations</a>. Here <br>
            are some I love. (Don’t worry

        <p id="intoo">In particular, the website’s use of <a href="">scalable vector graphic (SVG)</a> artwork is<br>
            stunning and adds a visual
            framework for communicating the site’s information. <br> Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with

            Take this great example from Intelligent Video <br> Solutions — its homepage meets you with a full-width <a
                href="">video background</a> and <br> overlays text, graphics, and a gradient to smoothly transition you
            down the
            page.</p>
        <p id="web">If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is <br> the best way.
            I think that
            it’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded <br> <a href="">iframe</a> from YouTube on your page.
        </p>
        <p id="news"><b>Pro Tip:</b> For <a href="">accessibility reasons</a>, it’s a good idea to let users pause
            videos and
            <br> also to let them choose
            whether or not the video plays sound.

        <p id="coton"><b>What I like:</b> Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might <br> guess,
            also
            makes great use
            of the HTML video element. I love how the homepage <br> immediately confronts you with a chaotic but
            immersive
            video montage of the <br>company’s work and dares you to watch more.</p>
        <p id="reder">The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element. You <br> can hover
            your cursor
            over a thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on it to <br> watch a longer video preview with sound.
            Plus, you can filter the works by <br> category (commercial, film, etc.).</p>
        <p id="pro">Pro Tip: Don’t neglect the power that video can have in immersing your users in <br> the world of
            your site. The
            best part is adding video to an HTML page example <br> is easy.</p>

        <p id="zxcv"><b>What I like:</b> <a href="">Microsites </a>allow brands to experiment with new web design <br>
            techniques while
            promoting a product.
            Mailchimp’s Dumpling Delivery website is a <br> prime example of this: Visitors can play nine holes of
            virtual
            miniature golf <br> in an attempt to deliver dumplings to hungry customers.</p>
        <p id="xsw">Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some <br> JavaScript magic
            happening in the background to make the game dynamics <br> possible. Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits
            of what you can
            accomplish with <br> HTML and JavaScript with some expert help.</p>
        <p id="nhy">The only thing that I don't like is that the website can <a href="">take a little longer to load</a>
            <br> on slower connections.
            However, this is expected, given how much interactivity is <br> going on with the site.
        </p>
        <p id="mjui"><b>Pro Tip:</b> I love how the music automatically pauses if a user opens another <br> window,
            which I think reinforces
            how interactivity is an integral part of the <br> experience.</p>
        <p id="lopk">8.<a href="">Make Your Move (Adidas)</a></p>
        <img src="your-move-adidas.webp" alt="" height="400px" width="660px" id="mnqs">
        <a href="" id="olrs">Image source</a>
        <p id="zxcv"><b>What I like:</b> Adidas made this microsite to promote the company’s global World <br> of Sports
            headquarters in
            Herzogenaurach, Germany. I like how it leverages video <br> and crisp images to help you experience the
            space
            from every angle.</p>
        <p id="zxcv">"The website does a good job of putting visitors on a pretty defined path for the <br> whole
            experience, starting
            with a video (displayed with the HTML5 video element) <br> and following up with an image slideshow to
            highlight
            the best parts of working <br> for the company.</p>
        <p id="zxcv">I also like that there's no scrolling down — everything happens with side <br>-to-side movement,
            which I noticed
            creates a linear feel to the storytelling experience.</p>
        <p id="zxcv">Pro Tip: Sometimes, a larger site doesn’t necessarily mean a better one. This is a <br> great
            example of using an
            HTML microsite can help tell a structured, digestible <br> story about your brand.</p>

        <p id="zxcv"><b>What I like:</b> Some websites use video to show, while others, like this example, use <br> it
            to immerse. Created by
            Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, the Take a Ride <br> With Me website experience drops you on the seat
            of a
            mountain bike as you’re <br> taken down treacherous trails across Europe.</p>
        <p id="zxcv">That said, the homepage of this site does layer on some interesting <a href="">cursor effects</a>
            <br> and scrolling effects for
            some added flair. For example, when you first land on the <br> site, the “Play” button follows your mouse
            cursor
            around, which I think creates an <br> interesting engagement effect (and also makes it easy for visitors to
            start
            the <br> experience).</p>
        <p id="zxcv"><b>Pro Tip:</b> Experiment with different cursor effects to determine if adding one is <br> intuitive for your site or
            if you’d be better off leaving it alone.</p>
